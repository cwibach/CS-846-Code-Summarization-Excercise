## 1. Example Problems

> **Instructions:** For each problem, generate documentation (docstrings/Doxygen comments) for the provided functions. Try first WITHOUT the guidelines, then WITH the guidelines to compare results.


### Problem C_1: Memory Pool Allocator (C)

**Task Description:**  
Generate Doxygen documentation for all functions in this memory pool implementation. Focus on the @brief, @param, @return, and any relevant @pre/@post conditions.

### Problem C_2: Ring Buffer (C)

**Task Description:**  
Generate Doxygen documentation for this lock-free single-producer single-consumer ring buffer. Pay attention to thread safety guarantees and memory ordering.

### Problem C_3: Configuration Parser (C)

**Task Description:**  
Generate documentation for this INI-style configuration file parser. Include information about error handling and memory ownership.

### Problem CPP_1: Smart Pointer with Custom Deleter (C++)

**Task Description:**  
Generate Doxygen documentation for this unique_ptr-like smart pointer with custom deleter support. Document exception safety and ownership semantics.

### Problem CPP_2: Thread-Safe Event Queue (C++)

**Task Description:**  
Generate documentation for this thread-safe event queue with timeout support. Pay special attention to thread safety guarantees and blocking behavior.

### Problem CPP_3: LRU Cache (C++)

**Task Description:**  
Generate documentation for this LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementation. Focus on time complexity guarantees and thread safety (or lack thereof).
