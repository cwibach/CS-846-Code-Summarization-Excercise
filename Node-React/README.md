This node-react app used a MySQL database to enable a housing search platform where users could find other potential roommates.

Note that enough key components are missing, that the code is not runnable in it's current state.

Node modules are included so they can be referenced to see what different backend functions do.

All component summaries follow the following structure:
/*
This component renders (description of what component contains)
prop1: description of first prop
prop2: description of 2nd prop
etc.
*/

If a component shows certain key information, that information should be mentioned
ex. for a unit it may show address, landlord email, # bedrooms, & # bathrooms
